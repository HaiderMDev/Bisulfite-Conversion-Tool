# Bisulfite-Conversion-Tool
This tool allows you to bisulfite convert a genomic region and tells you the total number of CpG in that region.
You will need to have python installed on your computer to run this software! 

#Comprehensive Bisulfite Conversion Tool:

This tool delivers the following:

    It will perform bisulfite conversion for your genomic sequence, provide you the sequence length, and tell you the number of CpG's in the sequence
    You can input 10 clones and it will compare to the original bisulfite converted sequence, determine percent methylation per clone, and the total methylation percentage based upon 10 clones
    It will draw a lollipop diagram for your region.

IMPORTANT: You have to input 10 clones in order for a correct readout for the total methylation percentage, as well as, the lollipop diaigram. Your individual clones all have to be the same length, and it has to match the length of the original sequence.
